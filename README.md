# Prime Tables Coding Challenge
Prime Tables is a small program that prints out a multiplication table based on
prime numbers without using Ruby's standard Prime class. By default, it will
print the first 10 prime numbers, but it's also possible to print up to 
N primes.

Notes: 
ruby print-table -n 12 // should print the first 12 prime numbers
ruby print-table // should print the first 10 numbers
